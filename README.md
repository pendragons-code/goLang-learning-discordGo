## learning discordGo

yup, the title is as it says, I am learning a language I wanted to try for a long time, but kept stopping due to time constraints

## instructions

fill up the .env file like this:
```
TOKEN = deliciousStuff
PREFIX = tastyprefix
```

run `go get ...` to download the packages and after that just run:

```
go build
./gogo
```

## TODO

[???] dynmic file for command handlers<br>
[] more commands that use more features from discord.go

## Learning resources

## About dynamic commands
I have no idea how to approach this. I mean, it all gets compiled in, how do you do it dynamically?
